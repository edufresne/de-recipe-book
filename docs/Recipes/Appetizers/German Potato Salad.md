# 🥔 German Potato Salad
Dharti's off the cuff Potato Salad that she made for a Christmas potluck. Everyone asked her for the recipe because it 
was so bomb. 
### Ingredients
- 2 lbs Potatoes (try to get a waxy kind, ie. Yellow, small, fingerlings)
- 1 Bunch of Dill
- 2-3 Medium Sized shallots
- 2-3 Garlic Cloves (measure with your heart)
- 6 slices of Thick Cut Bacon
- 3/2 Cup of Diced Gherkins
- 1/3 cup Apple Cider Vinegar
- 3 tbsp Dijon Mustard
- 2 tsp Sugar
- Salt & pepper
- A little Ghee if you have it

### Instructions
1. Boil potatoes in pot of salted cold water for ~15-20 minutes, until just fork tender
2. Drain immediately, put back into pot and cover to let potatoes steam for approx. 5 minutes
3. Let cool for 10 minutes, before adding dressing and toppings
4. In a separate skillet/pan, preferably stainless steel, but whatever is easiest for you, cook bacon, and then set aside to drain excess bacon grease on paper towel
5. Cut the bacon into small pieces, can be done before cooking, or after, whatever is easier for you
6. While bacon is cooking, and potatoes are boiling, do your mise-en-place for the sauce
7. Finely dice shallots
8. Mince the garlic
9. Medium chop for the dill
10. Dice gherkins
11. Measure out ACV and Dijon
12. Reserve about 2-3 tbsp of bacon fat, and if you are using it, add the ghee in skillet and add shallots, cook for 3-4 minutes until they start turning translucent on medium-low heat 
13. Add the garlic in and stir for about 30s until garlic is smelling garlicky
14. Add in your ACV, Dijon, and sugar to the pan and stir to deglaze the pan. _Pro tip, if you add all those things in a jar, and shake it really hard, it’ll all mix together, and then add it to the pan to get a more even glaze, without the sugar burning_
15. Keep on low heat until the sauce is reduced and thickened a bit, adding salt and pepper
16. Add more salt than you think, the sauce is going to taste a bit saltier, but it works with the potatoes (I have no real measurements for the salt, but probably 2 tsps?)
17. Add your gherkins, bacon and dill to a big bowl with your potatoes
18. Add all the sauce into the bowl and toss to make sure EVERYTHING is covered
19. Serve warm or cold, the longer it sits, the more flavour it’ll absorb, but German potato salads are usually served warm, but eat your food the way you like it.
